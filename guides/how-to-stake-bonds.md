# How to Stake Bonds

Bond staking allows bonders to earn extra rewards. Users who have previously bonded are eligible to earn bond staking rewards. The amount users can bond-stake is based on the the value of bonds previously purchased. For example, if a user have purchased $5000 USDT worth of bonds, they are eligible to stake up to $5000 USDT worth.
