**sGYRO increase in amount over time, while gGYRO increases in price.**

You still collect rebase rewards just as if you had sGYRO, but you won't see your token balance increase because the increase in value is based on the Current Index at the time of purchase and sale.

&#x20;When you unwrap your **gGYRO** tokens, you get back your original sGYRO plus any other sGYRO gained due to rebasing**.**



**Wrapping / Unwrapping sGYRO**

Click on the "Wrap / Unwrap" button in the ‘Wallet Balance’ section of the Dashboard.
